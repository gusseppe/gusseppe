## 👨‍💻 ML Research Engineer at Barcelona Supercomputing Center 💻
### Continual Learning for Production Systems | Trustworthy AI | MLOps

Hi there! I'm Gusseppe Bravo, a passionate ML Research Engineer with several years of experience working on Production ML systems, Continual Learning, Trustworthy AI and MLOps. I am currently working at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, where I get to work with one of the world's top supercomputers.

### 🤝 Collaboration
Currently, I'm collaborating with Lenovo (USA) in Continual Learning and Trustworthy AI.

### 💻 Skills
My expertise lies in Python, Spark, Java and C++ development for AI algorithms, MLOps, Numerical Analysis, Data Science, and Big Data. I am an Arctic Code Vault Contributor, and I love learning new technologies and exploring new domains.

### 🔬 Research Interests
- Continual Learning, Domain Incremental learning.
- Debugging Machine Learning models using AutoEncoders, Active Learning, and Interactive ML
- Trustworthiness: Drift detection using Trust scores. 
- Multiagents: Applied to Monitoring, Checking and Planning of ML models.
- MLOps: Custom implementations.

### 🌟 Personal Goal
I dream of creating an AI system that learns to adapt to different scenarios in real-time, just as humans adapt to situations naturally.
